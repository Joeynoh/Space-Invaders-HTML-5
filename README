Implementation of the classic game Space Invaders using HTML 5...

Current version: 0.0

### TODO ###

0.1
* add the interacion with keyboard (Z - move left, X - move right, SPACE - shoot)
* implement the ship movement
* create an object to handle the keyboard events

0.2
- structure the code only with objects. Create the main.js that will contains the main variables of the game and will load the game.js.
- rethink the way the main variables are accessed (for example the context size,...). Probably it's better to have a section in the game.js with all the main variables.

0.3
- create a laser object, that represents the shoot action
- implement the shooting action

0.4
- create the sprite object, with will make the player object simpler

0.5
- create the enemies object
- implement the movement of enemies

0.6
- detect collisions between a shoot and the enemies

### BUGS ###

- ship position is hardcoded
